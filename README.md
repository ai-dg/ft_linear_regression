# ft_linear_regression 
**An introduction to machine learning through linear regression**  

> Predict the price of a car based on its mileage using gradient descent and simple linear regression.

---

## ‚ñåProject Overview  

This project is a minimal and educational implementation of **linear regression** using **gradient descent** to predict the price of a car from its mileage.  
It serves as an introduction to **machine learning fundamentals**, written from scratch without using high-level libraries that do the work for you.

üìò Inspired by 42's AI curriculum: **you'll build and train your own model step-by-step**.

---

## ‚ñåFeatures  

‚úîÔ∏è Linear regression with **one feature** (car mileage)  
‚úîÔ∏è Manual implementation of **gradient descent**  
‚úîÔ∏è Interactive program to predict car prices  
‚úîÔ∏è Model parameters are saved and reused  
‚úîÔ∏è Clean and readable Python code  
‚úîÔ∏è Optional data visualization and model evaluation (Bonus)

## ‚ñåHow it works  

### ‚ñ† Hypothesis function  
The model is based on the simple linear formula:  
```text
estimatePrice(mileage) = theta0 + theta1 * mileage

Initially, theta0 and theta1 are set to 0.
Training is performed using gradient descent to minimize the cost between predicted and actual prices.
```


## ‚ñ† Training formulas
```txt
theta0 -= learningRate * (1/m) * Œ£(estimatePrice(x_i) - y_i)
theta1 -= learningRate * (1/m) * Œ£((estimatePrice(x_i) - y_i) * x_i)
```

## ‚ñåGetting Started
### ‚ñ† Requirements
‚ñ∏ Python 3.x
‚ñ∏ matplotlib (optional, for plotting bonus)
‚ñ∏ No use of libraries like numpy.polyfit or sklearn is allowed

### ‚ñ† Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-dg/ft_linear_regression.git
cd ft_linear_regression
```
2. Train your model
```bash
python3 train.py
```
3. Predict car price by mileage
```bash
python3 predict.py
```

## ‚ñåBonus Features
‚ñ∏ Graph showing the dataset points and the trained regression line

‚ñ∏ Model evaluation (e.g. mean squared error)

‚ñ∏ Robust error handling for inputs

‚ñ∏ Reusable model saved as JSON

These are only evaluated if the core program works flawlessly.
