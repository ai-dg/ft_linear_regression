**An introduction to machine learning through linear regression**

> Predict the price of a car based on its mileage using gradient descent and simple linear regression.

---

## ‚ñåProject Overview

This project is a minimal and educational implementation of **linear regression** using **gradient descent** to predict the price of a car from its mileage.\
It serves as an introduction to **machine learning fundamentals**, written from scratch without using high-level libraries that do the work for you.

üìò Inspired by 42's AI curriculum: **you'll build and train your own model step-by-step**.

## ‚ñåFeatures

‚úîÔ∏è Linear regression with **one feature** (car mileage)\
‚úîÔ∏è Manual implementation of **gradient descent**\
‚úîÔ∏è Interactive program to predict car prices\
‚úîÔ∏è Model parameters are saved and reused\
‚úîÔ∏è Clean and readable Python code\
‚úîÔ∏è Optional data visualization and model evaluation (Bonus)

## ‚ñåHow it works

### ‚ñ† Method Used

The model is trained using **simple linear regression** with **gradient descent optimization**. The objective is to minimize the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** between predicted and actual prices.

### ‚ñ† Hypothesis function

```text
estimatePrice(mileage) = theta0 + theta1 * mileage
```

- Initially, `theta0` and `theta1` can be set to 0 for visualizing convergence.
- Training is performed using gradient descent to minimize the cost.

### ‚ñ† Training formulas

```text
theta0 -= learningRate * (1/m) * Œ£(estimatePrice(x_i) - y_i)
theta1 -= learningRate * (1/m) * Œ£((estimatePrice(x_i) - y_i) * x_i)
```

## ‚ñåGetting Started

### ‚ñ† Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` (optional, for plotting bonus)

> ‚ùå No use of libraries like `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, or `pandas` is allowed.

### ‚ñ† Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-dg/ft_linear_regression.git
cd ft_linear_regression
```

2. (Optional) Edit `values.json` to start from scratch:

```json
{
  "theta0": 0,
  "theta1": 0,
  "max_km": 240000,
  "max_price": 8290.0
}
```

This allows you to visualize the evolution of `theta0`, `theta1`, and the MSE.

3. Train your model

```bash
python3 model.py
```

4. Predict car price by mileage

```bash
python3 prediction.py
```

## ‚ñåBonus Features

- ‚ñ† Graph showing the dataset points and the trained regression line
- ‚ñ† Real-time MSE display and convergence plot
- ‚ñ† Robust input and file error handling
- ‚ñ† Reusable model stored as JSON

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These features are only evaluated if the core program works flawlessly.

## ‚ñåExample

```bash
$ python3 model.py
Iteration 0: theta0 = 0.076, theta1 = 0.029
...
Iteration 9000: theta0 = 1.02528, theta1 = -0.62095
Entra√Ænement termin√©. Param√®tres sauvegard√©s.
MAE (Erreur absolue moyenne) : 557.84 ‚Ç¨

$ python3 prediction.py
Enter mileage: 50000
Estimated price: ‚Ç¨11,378.24
```
